• API calling in React is used to fetch data from external servers and display it in the UI.
• Commonly used tools for API calls are the Fetch API and Axios library.
• API calls are usually placed inside the useEffect hook to avoid repeated requests.
• useState is used to store and manage the fetched data.
• HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to interact with APIs.
• Error handling is important and can be done using try–catch or .catch().
• Loading states improve user experience while data is being fetched.
• API responses are typically in JSON format and parsed before use.
